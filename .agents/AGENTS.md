# Agent Rules
You are a **principal engineer** in this monorepo. Follow all rules defined here.

## AI Tools Available

This project uses the following AI-powered tools:

- **Serena** — Advanced code navigation and symbol manipulation (find symbols, replace content, rename, refactor, diagnostics, and memory system)
- **Headroom** — Context compression for large outputs (compress/retrieve/stats to save token usage)
- **RTK (Reading Toolkit)** — Enhanced file reading utilities installed globally
- **OpenSpec** — Structured workflow for feature development (propose → implement → verify → archive). Changes are tracked in `openspec/changes/`, with main specs in `openspec/specs/`

You have access to these tools' functions. Use them when appropriate for better performance and precision.

## OpenAI + Claude Compatibility

- Source of truth for skills is `.agents/skills/*` with `SKILL.md` as the main definition.
- OpenAI/Codex entrypoint is root `AGENTS.md` (bridges to `.agents/AGENTS.md`).
- Claude entrypoint is root `CLAUDE.md`.
- Codex/OpenAI metadata lives in `agents/openai.yaml` with `interface` / `policy` / `dependencies` schema when needed.
- Claude skill wrappers live in `.claude/skills/*` and must be synced from source of truth.
- Registry table and skill reference lists are generated from `manifest.json` via `bun run skills:sync-registry`.
- After adding/renaming/editing skill metadata, run: `bun run skills:sync`
- Before merging skill asset changes, run: `bun run skills:validate`

<!-- skill-registry:end -->

## Core Principles

- **Minimal code** — write as little code as possible to complete the task. Don't over-engineer.
- **Precision over speed** — be fast, but results must be correct and match requirements.
- **Don't assume** — if something is ambiguous or unclear, ask first. Don't silently pick.
- **Suggest simpler alternatives** — push back if warranted.
- **Best practices required** — always apply current best practices for every technology used (Next.js App Router, Hono, BullMQ, Prisma, React Query, Zod, etc.).
- **Search the web if unsure** — if you're not certain about the best approach or want to verify the latest version/API, **search the web first**. Don't guess, don't use old patterns when better ones exist.
- **Follow the established flow** — don't skip phases. The vibe coding flow has an order: propose → implement → verify. Each phase has its skill, follow it.

## OpenSpec Requirement

**All code changes MUST go through the OpenSpec workflow.**

Why:
- **Structured thinking** — forces upfront design before implementation, reducing rework
- **Traceability** — every feature has proposal, specs, design, and tasks documented in `openspec/changes/`
- **Quality assurance** — changes are reviewed against specs before archiving
- **Context preservation** — future agents/developers can understand why decisions were made
- **Collaboration** — clear handoff between propose → implement → verify phases

Exceptions (direct implementation allowed):
- Trivial fixes (typos, formatting, dead code removal)
- Maintenance tasks (dependency updates, config adjustments)
- Documentation-only changes
- Emergency hotfixes (must be documented retroactively)

For feature work, bug fixes with business logic impact, or refactoring: **always start with `/opsx:propose`**.

## Start Session Protocol

If the user only types:
- `Start`
- `Mulai`
- `Mulai Vibe Coding`
- or similar start session variants

then **MUST** treat it as an onboarding session, not a direct implementation task.

Required steps:
1. Read `.agents/settings.json`
2. Run `bun run session:status`
3. Summarize MCP status, branch, and worktree
4. Classify session state:
   - possible first init
   - possible resume of last task
   - ready for new work item
5. Ask **one** clear next-step question

Default next step priority:
1. MCP not ready → direct to `ops-mcp-setup`
2. Active branch/task exists → offer to resume last task
3. Repo ready and user wants to start fresh → direct to OpenSpec `/opsx:propose`

## Vibe Coding Flow

> **MUST follow this order. Don't skip phases.**

### Phase 1 — Propose (OpenSpec)
Use `/opsx:propose` to turn a feature idea into proposal + specs + design + tasks.
```
Output: openspec/changes/{slug}/
          proposal.md
          specs/
          design.md
          tasks.md
```

### Phase 2 — Implementation (per task from OpenSpec)

Execution order per feature — **don't reverse**:

#### 2a. FE Slicing
> Skill: `web-slicing`
- UI from design/description, use dummy data first
- Target: `apps/web/app/(group)/[feature]/`
- Output: `page.tsx` + `[feature]-content.tsx`

#### 2b. Backend + OpenAPI
> Skill: `api-feature` + `docs-openapi`
- Implement Clean Architecture: entity → use case → repository → controller → route
- Write split OpenAPI documentation alongside
- Target: `apps/api/src/` + `docs/openapi/`

#### 2c. FE ↔ API Integration
> Skill: `web-api-integrated`
- Zod schema, response types, constants, react-query hooks
- Wire the sliced UI to the running API
- Target: `packages/schemas/` + `packages/types/` + `apps/web/hooks/transactions/use-{domain}/` + `apps/web/constants/`

### Phase 3 — Verify & Archive
Use `/opsx:verify` for validation, then `/opsx:archive` for archiving.

### Phase 4 — Unit Test, Build & PR
Run before creating PR:
```bash
cd apps/web && bun run test
cd apps/api && bun run test
bun run build
```

After all pass:
1. Create PR
2. PR body: link to issue + implementation checklist

## Coding Guidelines

### Biome (Linter & Formatter) — MUST FOLLOW
> **Always read `biome.json` at root before writing code.**

Active rules that must be followed:
- **`noExplicitAny`: error** — `any` is forbidden. Always provide explicit types.
- **`noConsole`: error** — `console.log/warn/error` is forbidden. Use a proper logger or remove.
- **`useConst`: error** — use `const` if variable is not reassigned.
- **`noUnusedVariables`: error** — remove unused variables.
- **`noUnusedImports`: error** — remove unused imports.
- **Formatter:** indent `space` width 2, quote `"double"`, semicolons `asNeeded` (no semicolons at end of JS/TS lines).

Before submitting, ensure your code passes all rules above. If not, fix first.

### Enums — MUST be Shared from `packages/schemas/`
If a field/value has a fixed set of values, **MUST** declare as a shared enum. Values always `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`. Source of truth is `packages/schemas/`:

```typescript
// packages/schemas/status.ts
export const statuses = ['ACTIVE', 'INACTIVE', 'ON_PROGRESS'] as const
export type Status = (typeof statuses)[number]
```

- **Prisma**: don't declare enum separately — use `String` + `@default()`, validate via Zod schema
- **BE entity/DTO**: import type from `@vibecoding-starter/schemas`
- **FE schema/form**: import `as const` array + `z.enum()` from `@vibecoding-starter/schemas`

One declaration, one import, all layers use the same.

### Simplicity First
- No features beyond what's requested.
- No abstractions for code used only once.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If 200 lines can be 50, rewrite.
- Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### Surgical Changes
- Only touch what must change. Clean up only the mess you made.
- Don't "improve" code, comments, or formatting outside the task scope.
- Don't refactor what isn't broken.
- Follow existing code style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If there's dead code not from your changes, mention it — don't delete.
- Remove imports/variables/functions that **your changes** made unused.
- **Test:** every changed line must trace directly to the user's request.

## Task Management

- **Create a task checklist** before starting work.
- **Check off each task** immediately after completion, don't batch.
- **Before considering done**, review the entire checklist — ensure all tasks are checked.
- **Goal-driven** — transform tasks into verifiable goals:
  - "Add validation" → write test for invalid input, then pass it
  - "Fix bug" → write test that reproduces, then pass it
  - "Refactor X" → ensure tests pass before and after

## Application Flow (MUST FOLLOW)

> Read `.agents/guides/ARCHITECTURE.md` for full layer map and folder contracts.

### apps/web (Next.js Frontend)

```
Rendering (UI Layer):
  apps/web/app/ (router)
    └→ page.tsx (thin Suspense wrapper)
        └→ *-content.tsx (Client Component — all logic: hooks, state, form, table, dialog)
            └→ apps/web/components/ (reusable components: Button, Input, Table, Dialog, etc.)

Data Flow (data transactions):
  *-content.tsx
    └→ apps/web/hooks/transactions/use-{domain}/ (custom hooks)
        └→ react-query (useQuery / useMutation)
            └→ axios instance (services/axios/)
                └→ API Server

Validation (input):
  Form (useForm + react-hook-form)
    └→ packages/schemas/ (shared Zod schema)

Typing:
  API response → packages/types/
  Form payload → z.infer<schema> (packages/schemas/)
  General      → apps/web/types/generals/
```

**FORBIDDEN:** JSX components calling axios/fetch directly — must go through hooks.
**FORBIDDEN:** creating `_components/` folder per page — put everything in content file, except components reusable across pages.

### apps/api (Hono Backend — Clean Architecture)

```
HTTP Request
  → apps/api/src/interfaces/http/routes/    (Zod validation, delegate to controller)
  → apps/api/src/interfaces/http/controllers/ (parse request, call service, format response)
  → apps/api/src/application/services/       (orchestrate use case, transform Entity → DTO)
  → apps/api/src/application/use-cases/      (business logic, throw DomainError)
  → apps/api/src/infrastructure/database/    (query Prisma, return Entity)
  ↑
  bubbles up → errorHandler middleware → HTTP Response

Error Handling:
  DomainError → errorHandler middleware
    ├── NOT_FOUND    → 404
    ├── UNAUTHORIZED → 401
    ├── FORBIDDEN    → 403
    ├── CONFLICT     → 409
    ├── VALIDATION   → 422
    └── INTERNAL     → 500
```

**FORBIDDEN:** business logic in Controller, Prisma/HTTP in Use Case, HTTPException from Use Case.

### apps/worker (BullMQ Worker)

```
BullMQ Worker scaffold
  → apps/worker/src/infrastructure/queue/ (worker registration)
  → apps/worker/src/application/use-cases/ (runtime summary / job orchestration)
  → feature-specific queues added when actually needed
```

### packages/ (Shared)

```
packages/schemas/  → Zod schemas (used by web + api + worker)
packages/types/    → API response types (used by web + api)
packages/utils/    → Pure TS utilities (used by all)
```

**Shared packages rules:**
- `packages/schemas/` → only Zod schema + inferred types + shared constants
- `packages/types/` → only TypeScript types for API responses
- `packages/utils/` → only pure functions without FE/BE-specific dependencies
